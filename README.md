Hi 👋 My name is Szymon Tamborski
=====================================

Software Developer, Ice Skater
--------------------------

* 🏡  I'm based in Warsaw,
* 💻  I'm currently working on [job-offers-warehouse](http://gitlab.com/szytambsky1/job-offers-warehouse),
* 🔧  Maintainer of [Posbus](https://github.com/szytambsky/komunikacjalive),
* 🔭  But above all, learning everything Java related

I have been programming for some time now. My main interests are web and mobile applications. Currently, I spend most of my time in the JVM ecosystem. I draw my knowledge from online sources, documentations and books. For those who are also at the beginning of the road, from me I can recommend: "Clean Code" - Robert C. Martin, "Grokking Algorithms and" - Aditya Y. Bhargava, "Effective Java" - Bloch, Joshua. Recently, I have also been attending and trying to contribute to the local Java community: WJUG (Warsaw Java User Group) 

I have to brag 😸 I was at the last 296 WJUG and managed to place 3rd at the end in a quiz on the questions for the lecture there.
